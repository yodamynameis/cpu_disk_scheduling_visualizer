# CPU and Disk Scheduler Visualizer

A Python Tkinter application for visualizing CPU and disk scheduling algorithms with interactive Gantt charts and performance metrics.

## Features

- **CPU Scheduling Algorithms**:
  - FCFS (First Come First Serve)
  - SJF (Shortest Job First)
  - SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)
  - Round Robin
  - Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)
  - Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)

- **Disk Scheduling Algorithms**:
  - FCFS
  - SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
  - SCAN
  - C-SCAN

- **Visualization**:
  - Interactive Gantt charts
  - Consistent process colors
  - Real-time performance metrics
  - Center-aligned metrics tables

## Installation

1. **Create project directory**:
```bash
mkdir scheduler_visualizer
cd scheduler_visualizer
